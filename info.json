  "description": "When machines have multiple inventories, restrict inserter access to a specific one (or grant access to one previously inaccessible). Avoid common pitfalls of confusing fuel, ingredients, and cargo:\n\nPlatforms waiting on a bumbling swarm of logistic bots to prepare deliveries of blue circuits as inserters sit tragically idle beside a silo? Finding train fuel in exciting new places after a quick stop at the wrong depot? Biochambers in your goldfish farm burning legendary fish food?\n\nNever again!",
